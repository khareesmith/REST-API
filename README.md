## What and Why

This application serves as a demonstration in REST API's. Basic functionality will include the ability to:

 1. Add games to a database using various parameters.
 2. Add publishers and developers to a database.
 3. Bring up list of all games in database.
 4. Bring up list of various publishers and developers.
 5. Update any information in game, developer, or publisher routes
 6. Delete any information in same routes.


The biggest use for this application is both a showcase of my technical abilities at this moment in time as well as practice for web application that will display information cleanly.
